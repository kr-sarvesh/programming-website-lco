## About

This project is created using HTML and CSS. 
I have used CSS Positioning and CSS flex-box to build this project, and this project is not fully responsive. 
I will try to make it responive in future.

## Time taken to finish this project?

Although this project looks simple and easy but when I started working on it, it took me around 5 to 6 hour to finish it.
